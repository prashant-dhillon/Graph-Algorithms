Question 4. Improving the estimation of the time of the journey

for this there are two proposed methods:
1) by modifying the network: we can modify the metro graph network by addind the weight of 20 seconds to each weight between two stations.
                                But it is not my preferred solution because if wait time increases we have to modify the entire network each time.

2) by modifying the algorithm: we can also include the wait time on each station by modifyting the algorithm, as in the Dijkstra algorithm
                                we can add this wait time in g->v_sommet field every time we move from one vertex to another after calculation
                                of shortest path i.e, in our case here g->v_sommets[v_count_succ] = g->v_sommets[v_count] + p->v_arc + waitTime
